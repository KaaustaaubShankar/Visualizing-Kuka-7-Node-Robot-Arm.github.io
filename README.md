## Visualizing the Movements of Kuka 7 Node Robot Arm through Unity and C ##

### ðŸ‘‰ Inspiration

The inspiration for Visualizing Kuka 7 Node Robot Arm came from our interest in robotics and automation. We wanted to create a tool that could help engineers and researchers visualize the movements of a Kuka 7 Node Robot Arm. Coming into the hackathon, we wanted to do something related to that and we ended up running into Mitchell of Kinetic Vision who told us that there was a challenge relating to visualizing the movement of the robot.

### ðŸ‘‰ What It Does

Visualizing Kuka 7 Node Robot Arm is a web application hosted through WebGL that allows users to interactively visualize the movements of a Kuka 7 Node Robot Arm through the use of sliders. Users can adjust the angles of each joint and see how it affects the position of the end effector. The application also includes a variety of pre-built sequences that demonstrate the capabilities of the robot arm. The application is also able to interpret the CSV file provided by Kinetic Vision to create a moving visualization of the Kuka 7 Node Robot.
